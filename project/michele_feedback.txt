Great job finishing the app! The picture you have on your background is very silly =). There were many different ways to get the timer / clock to work, and the way you chose is great. I really really like that you give me (the user) two ways of getting feedback - one thing is that you tell me what time the app thinks the time currently is, and the other is that you tell me what time the app will make the alarm go off. Because it is at first unclear what I should type into the boxes, having these two points of feedback is a great way for me to make sure that what I did is correct. Great job.
